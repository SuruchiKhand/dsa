Write an algorithm to find the maximum number of chocolates that can be picked from the jars in such a way that the chocolates are not picked from jars next to each other.

Input
The first line of input consists of an integer- numJars, representing the number of jars(N).
The next line consists if N space separated integers representing the number of jars(N).

Output:
Print the maximum number of chocolates that can be picked from the jars(N).

The next line consists of N space separated integers representing the number of chocolates in each jar.

Example:
Input:
6
5 30 99 60 5 10

Output:
114

Explanation:
Andrew picks from the 1st(5), 3rd(99) and 6th(10) jars. So, the output is 114.
