Write an algorithm to find the mean and mode of a set of given numbers.
Note: If the mean calculated is in decimal, print its floor value(Floor is the greatest integer less than or equal to that number:floor[2.4]=2)

Example:
Input:
5
1 2 7 3 2
Output:
3 2

Explanation:
The mean for the given set of numbers is (1+2+7+3+2) = 15, 15/5 = 3). The mode is themost frequently occuring muner which is 2. So the output is 3,2
